## Public documentation

The documentation may be found on [ReadTheDocs](neat.readthedocs.io).

This documentation is built automatically when the master branch is updated.

## How to build documentation locally

Building the documentation locally is not necessary to contribute to the
documentation.

Prerequisites:
- Sphinx
- Sphinx RtD theme

These may be installed either through PIP or the package manager of your
distribution.

Once these have been installed, you may use the provided Makefile.

To generate HTML documentation: `make html`.

The makefile also contains a (non-standard) target to rebuild the documentation
upon changes to the documentation files. For this to work, sphinx-autobuild
must be installed. To make use of this, execute `make livehtml`. Note that this
feature does not work when adding new files. When adding a new file, `make
html` must be executed at least once first.

## How to update the documentation

To add a new page to the documentation, create a new file. The file
`_templates/template.md` may be used as a starting point. Add a reference to
this file in `index.rst`.
