These scripts provide porting help from the BSD Sockets API to the
NEAT Sockets API. The scripts are simple, and only intended for
simplifying the porting process. They will *not* automatically
transform your program into a NEAT program! Some manual work will
still be necessary!


1. find-socket-functions file1 [file2 ...]

find-socket-functions identifies possible places in the given source file(s)
to adapt to the NEAT Sockets API.


2. neatify-source-file file:line_number

Replaces the given line line_number in the given file by a NEAT Sockets API
variant.

WARNING:
* This replacement may be incomplete or wrong!
* A manual check is necessary!
* Always keep a backup of the original file!!!


3. replace-socket-functions file1 [file2 ...]

replace-socket-functions runs find-socket-functions to identify lines
that may require replacement by NEAT Sockets API functions, and runs
neatify-source-file to make the replacements.
