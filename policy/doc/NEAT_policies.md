# NEAT Policies

==WIP==

A policy is said to *match* a candidate whenever *all* of its match properties are found in the candidate properties. PIB entries are matched with a *shortest match first* strategy, i.e., policies with the smallest number of `match` properties are applied first. Subsequent, policies will *overwrite* any perviously applied policy properties. Conflicting policies must be identified by the NEAT logic.
